# SE(3)-bi-equivariant Transformers for Point Cloud Assembly
This is the official implement of the NeurIPS24 paper "SE(3)-bi-equivariant Transformers for Point Cloud Assembly".

## What does the model do?
The model is used to solve point cloud assembly problems, where the goal is to align two pieces of point clouds (may not be overlapped).
